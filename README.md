This folder contains a series of coding problems that I have practiced on leetcode type websites or during technical assessments that I wanted to review after the fact.

**ReactCounter**

Make the counter increase every time the button is pressed in JS

**RomanNumerals**

Have the function BasicRomanNumerals(str) read str which will be a string of Roman numerals. The numerals being used are: I for 1, V for 5, X for 10, L for 50, C for 100, D for 500 and M for 1000. In Roman numerals, to create a number like 11 you simply add a 1 after the 10, so you get XI. But to create a number like 19, you use the subtraction notation which is to add an I before an X or V (or add an X before an L or C). So 19 in Roman numerals is XIX. The goal of your program is to return the decimal equivalent of the Roman numeral given. For example: if str is "XXIV" your program should return 24

**ApproachingFibonacci**

Have the function ApproachingFibonacci(arr) take the arr parameter being passed which will be an array of integers and determine the smallest positive integer including zero that can be added to the array to make the sum of all of the numbers in the array add up to the next closest fibonacci number

**AWSRetrieveS3BucketFilename**

Access a public S3 Bucket and print all filenames that start with "__cb__"
